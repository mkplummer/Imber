# Imber
Doppler imaging tool created by [Michael K. Plummer](michaelplummer.dev) for modeling stellar/substellar surfaces. They Python module simulates spectroscopic and photometric observations with both a gridded, numerical simulation and analytical model. Imber has been specifically designed to predict Extremely Large Telescope instrument (e.g. ELT/METIS and TMT/MODHIS) Doppler imaging performance. It has also been applied to existing, archival observations of spectroscopy and photometry to model surface features on Luhman 16B, a nearby L/T transition brown dwarf.

Numerical simulator applications:
-Creating spotted surface maps
-Generating time-varying spectra, line profiles, and light curves based on spotted features.

Analytical Model applications:
